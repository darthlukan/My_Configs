dotfiles
==========

Config files that I use on all of my Linux systems.

All config files are from my $HOME directory, as such, all configs
in this repo fall under HOME.  The simplest way of being able
to use all of these files (if you're that brave) is to clone
this repo, cd into it and execute:

```bash
	cp -r HOME/* ~/
```

All of my config files will be copied into your home directory.

For individual config files, simply copy them into your desired
sub-directories and you're good to go.

Please note:

	All of these config files are used on my Linux systems,
	specifically, Arch Linux.  Other distros have settings
	that may override these files by default, the only way
	to know if your distro does this is to either read through
	your distro documentation, or "trial and error".
